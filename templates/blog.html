    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="blog-prose">
      We've been tracking pull request review time across hundreds of popular public GitHub
      repositories. The numbers above update in real time as new repos are synced and new
      PRs are merged. Here's what the aggregate data tells us about how code review actually
      works in practice — and where the bottlenecks tend to be.

    <h2>PR Size and Review Time</h2>
    <p class="blog-prose">
      One of the clearest signals in the data is the relationship between pull request size
      and how long it takes to get reviewed and merged. Smaller PRs tend to move faster —
      but the effect is non-linear and varies significantly across repos and teams.

  <section class="blog-section">
    <h2>Review Behavior Patterns</h2>
    <p class="blog-prose">
      Not all reviews are equal. Some contributors consistently push back with
      <em>changes requested</em>, acting as quality gatekeepers. Others approve quickly.
      Both patterns show up clearly in the leaderboards.

    <h2>The Fastest (and Slowest) Repos</h2>
    <p class="blog-prose">
      Repo culture matters enormously. The fastest repos in the dataset merge PRs in minutes.
      The slowest take months. The difference isn't just team size — it's process, tooling,
      and explicit review norms.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p class="blog-prose">
      Data is collected from public GitHub repositories via the GitHub REST API. Only merged
      pull requests are included in the timing calculations. Review time is measured from
      PR open to PR merge. Repos with fewer than 3 merged PRs are excluded from leaderboards.
      All raw data is browsable on the <a href="/data" class="link">data explorer</a>.
